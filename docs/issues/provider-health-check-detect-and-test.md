# Provider health check / Detect & Test

## Problem

There is **no CLI detection feedback or health check anywhere**. No provider settings tab has a
"Test connection / Detect CLI / status" affordance. CLI resolution failure only surfaces *after the first
send* as an inline stream error (`"Claude CLI not found…"`, `"Failed to start OpenCode. Check the CLI path
and login state."`). A new user setting a CLI path gets zero confirmation it resolved until a turn fails.
This is the #1 onboarding journey with no validation gate and the largest support-ticket category
(`spawn claude ENOENT`, login state).

## Evidence

- `src/providers/claude/runtime/ClaudeChatRuntime.ts:1165`; `OpencodeChatRuntime.ts:356` — failures only at send time.
- Provider settings tabs (`ClaudeSettingsTab.ts`, `CodexSettingsTab.ts`, …) have only descriptive copy, no test button.

## Proposed change

Add a synchronous "Detect & Test" button per provider settings tab that runs the existing `*CliResolver`
and shows the resolved CLI path + auth/login state (and a clear fix hint on failure). Lead with
auto-detection (per README guidance), not "set the path manually."

## Acceptance criteria

- Each provider tab has a Detect & Test action surfacing resolved path + auth state, with a failure hint.
- Verified manually for at least one provider where credentials are available.
