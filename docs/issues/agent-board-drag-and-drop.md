# Agent Board drag-and-drop

## Problem

`AgentBoardRenderer.ts` has **zero drag handlers** — all lane transitions are button-driven
(Mark ready / Run / Stop / Accept / Rework). For a "kanban" board this violates the strongest user
expectation and makes the board feel unfinished.

## Proposed change

Add drag-and-drop between lanes that drives the same `TaskStateMachine` transitions the buttons use
(respecting transition rules — invalid drops rejected). Keyboard-accessible alternative is covered by the
`accessibility-pass` issue; this issue is the pointer DnD itself.

## Acceptance criteria

- Cards can be dragged between lanes; invalid transitions are rejected with feedback.
- Drag-drop uses the existing state-machine transition rules (no bypass).
- Buttons remain as an equivalent path.
