# Agent Board background / long-running runs

## Already shipped (do NOT rebuild)

> **Frontmatter sync (2026-06-07):** status is `partially-shipped` because this shipped non-activated work-order tabs, but still tracks live card streaming and truly detached/provider-native background runs.
> The separate visibility problem (work-order badges cluttering the chat tab row) is now tracked by [[Work-Order execution shall not consume available chat tabs]] and planned in [[2026-06-07-work-order-activity-dropdown]].

Work orders **already run in a non-activated background tab** — `ChatTabExecutionSurface.startTaskRun` →
`ClaudianView.startTaskRunInFreshTab` → `TabManager.createTaskRunTab`, which creates the run tab with
`activate: false` (`TabManager.ts:249,260`), so a run does not steal focus. This issue is **not** about
re-implementing background execution.

## Problem (narrowed)

Two gaps remain beyond the non-activated tab:

1. **Live progress streaming into the board card.** The user must still open the run's tab to see what's
   happening; the Agent Board card does not stream live status/progress. (Verify: no live progress feed
   from the run tab into `AgentBoardRenderer`.)
2. **Truly detached / provider-native background runs.** Each run still occupies a (hidden) chat tab.
   The ecosystem direction is provider-native background tasks — Claude Code `/bg`, Codex Automations —
   that run without a tab at all. This is the differentiator vs chat-only rivals.

## Proposed change

- Stream live run status/progress from the execution surface into the work order's Agent Board card
  (no need to open the tab).
- Investigate a truly-detached run path using provider-native background tasks where available
  (`/bg`, Automations), falling back to the existing non-activated tab otherwise.
- Preserve the non-regression rule: ad-hoc chat stays first-class.

## Acceptance criteria

- An Agent Board card shows live progress for an in-flight run **without opening its tab**.
- Where a provider exposes background tasks, a run can execute without occupying a chat tab.
- Run lifecycle (start/stop/retry) and one-active-run-per-work-order still hold; chat sidepanel unchanged.
