# Reduce core/providers/types.ts import-type cycles (low value)

## Problem

`npx madge --circular` reports **58** cycles (drifted up from 52). The worst root in
`src/core/providers/types.ts:1-20`, a type-hub that round-trips imports back from `bootstrap/storage`,
`runtime/ChatRuntime`, `providers/commands/ProviderCommandCatalog`, and `types/PluginContext`.

## Important caveat

**All these imports are `import type`** — erased at compile time, zero runtime initialization-order risk.
Madge counts them but they are not a hazard. **Do not prioritize the cycle count.** This issue exists only
so the finding is tracked, not as a call to action.

## Proposed change (if pursued)

Split `core/providers/types.ts` so the `ChatRuntime` / `ProviderCommandCatalog` / `PluginContext` type
re-exports do not round-trip. Effort: S. Value: low.

## Acceptance criteria

- Cycle count drops without changing emitted JS or any runtime behavior.
