# Rename YOLO / Safe permission labels

## Problem

The chat permission toggle still ships user-facing "YOLO"/"Safe" labels — off-brand for the
non-developer audience the product targets, and flagged in the 2026-05-28 research proposal and Obsidian
review norms. (`src/providers/claude/ui/ClaudeChatUIConfig.ts` permission-mode labels; similar in other
providers' `*ChatUIConfig.ts`.)

## Proposed change

Rename the user-facing labels to clearer terms — **Review actions / Auto-approve workspace edits / Plan
first / Read-only** — while keeping the internal `yolo` value for compatibility. A one-time danger-mode
warning already gates the opt-in; keep it.

## Acceptance criteria

- No user-facing "YOLO"/"Safe" strings remain in the chat toggle; internal `yolo` value unchanged.
- i18n keys added for the new labels across locales (fallback to English allowed).
