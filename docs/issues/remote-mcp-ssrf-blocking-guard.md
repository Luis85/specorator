# Remote-MCP SSRF blocking guard + transport hygiene

## Problem

Remote (SSE/HTTP) MCP servers are connected with **no SSRF guard**: `McpTester` hands vault-supplied URLs
directly to `new URL(...)` and the SDK transport with a custom Node fetch. Pressing **Test** on a
vault-supplied URL server can make the user's machine contact `169.254.169.254` (cloud metadata),
localhost, or other private services. There are also no provenance/risk labels, no plaintext-`http://`
warning, and tool descriptions are treated as fully trusted.

## Evidence

- `src/core/mcp/McpTester.ts:50-113` (raw `http`/`https` fetch, no host allow/deny), `:253` (`new URL`, no scheme/host check).
- MCP UI files: no warning/provenance/risk surfaces.

## Proposed change (block, don't just warn)

A warning a malicious vault can pre-acknowledge is not a control. **Before opening the socket** in
`McpTester`/the SDK transport:

- Resolve the target host and **deny** link-local (`169.254.0.0/16`, incl. metadata `169.254.169.254`),
  loopback, RFC1918/IPv6-ULA private ranges, and internal-only hosts.
- **Pin the connection to the vetted IP** — a preflight resolve + separate connect is *still*
  DNS-rebinding-vulnerable (TOCTOU): Node/the MCP SDK's `http.request` performs its **own** lookup when it
  opens the socket, so a hostname can pass the guard with a public answer and then rebind to a private
  address for the real connection. Enforce the vetted IP via a custom `lookup` on the agent/transport (or
  connect directly to the checked IP while preserving `Host`/SNI), so the IP that was checked is the IP that
  receives the socket.
- This deny is mandatory for vault-provenance servers.

Then layer UX on top: non-loopback `http://` warning, destination host + provenance (vault vs user-added),
untrusted-tool-description framing.

## Acceptance criteria

- A Test against a link-local/loopback/private host is **refused before any socket opens** (with a clear message).
- Provenance + destination host shown in the enable/test UI; tool descriptions rendered as untrusted.
- Unit tests cover the deny ranges incl. a DNS-rebinding (hostname→private IP) case, asserting the socket
  connects to the **vetted** IP (not a re-resolved one).
- **Not done while the Test path can still reach private services.**

## Resolution (2026-06-09)

**Shipped — the blocking control:**

- `src/core/security/urlSafety.ts` (new): `assertSafeRemoteUrl` preflight
  (http/https-only scheme check; literal-IP hostnames classified without DNS;
  DNS answers vetted in full — ANY private record denies; resolution failure
  fails closed) over a denylist covering loopback (127/8, `::1`), link-local
  (169.254/16 incl. `169.254.169.254`, fe80::/10), RFC1918, RFC6598
  shared/CGNAT (100.64/10), IPv6 ULA
  (fc00::/7), unspecified (0.0.0.0/8, `::`), IANA non-global ranges
  (multicast 224/4 + ff00::/8, reserved 240/4 incl. broadcast, benchmarking
  198.18/15 + 2001:2::/48, documentation TEST-NET-1/2/3 + 2001:db8::/32 +
  3fff::/20, IETF 192.0.0/24, deprecated 6to4 anycast 192.88.99/24, IPv6
  discard-only 100::/64, ORCHID 2001:10::/28 + 2001:20::/28, SRv6 5f00::/16,
  local-use NAT64 64:ff9b:1::/48), and embedded-IPv4 forms
  (IPv4-mapped `::ffff:0:0/96`, IPv4-compatible `::/96`, NAT64 `64:ff9b::/96`).
- **Rebinding pin implemented**: `createPinnedLookup` returns a custom
  `net.LookupFunction` passed through `createNodeFetch({ lookup })` into
  `http(s).request`, so the socket receives the preflight-vetted addresses for
  the vetted hostname — it is never re-resolved (no TOCTOU window). Any other
  hostname the transport dials is vetted inside the same lookup call.
  `Host`/SNI/cert validation keep using the hostname; only address resolution
  is constrained. The MCP SDK (1.29.0) routes all Streamable HTTP and legacy
  SSE requests through the provided `fetch`, so both transports are covered.
- `McpTester.testMcpServer` refuses unsafe URLs before any transport or client
  object is constructed, with a clear `Blocked for safety: …` message. The
  deny applies to all URL-based servers regardless of provenance (stdio
  servers are untouched). Loopback is denied by default; the module's
  `allowLoopback` option is reserved for a future explicit user opt-in.
- Tests: deny-range matrix per family, literal-IP URLs, mocked-DNS
  hostname→private and mixed multi-A-record cases, fail-closed resolution, and
  a socket-level pin test (`createNodeFetch.test.ts`) asserting the connection
  reaches the vetted IP for a hostname real DNS would not resolve there.

**Residual (why partially-shipped, not done):**

- Transport-hygiene UX: provenance (vault vs user-added) + destination-host
  labels, non-loopback `http://` warning, and untrusted-tool-description
  framing are not implemented in the MCP settings UI.
- No settings surface yet wires the loopback policy (Test path: strict deny;
  runtime path: allow — localhost MCP is a supported dev workflow).
- Runtime activation is vetted too (2026-06-10, PR #74 review follow-up):
  `src/core/mcp/mcpRuntimeVetting.ts` drops unsafe URL-based servers (fail
  closed, per-server) at both Claude seams — cold start (`queryViaSDK`, warns
  via notice chunk) and `applyClaudeDynamicUpdates`/`setMcpServers` (warns via
  `notifyFailure`) — before configs reach the CLI. Remaining scope gap: the
  rebinding pin only covers the plugin's own sockets; provider CLIs resolve
  DNS themselves after the vetted handoff.
