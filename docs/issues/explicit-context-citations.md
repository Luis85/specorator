# Explicit-context citations (Phase A)

## Problem

There is **zero citation rendering**. Agent answers never cite which note/selection/range grounded them;
`ContextSourceHandle` does not exist. Citations are "table stakes" in the Obsidian AI market; Claudian is
at parity-zero here.

## Evidence

- grep for citation/cite/source-handle/grounding returns only unrelated hits.

## Proposed change

Phase A only (no embeddings/RAG): emit `ContextSourceHandle` entries from the context envelope
(see `composer-context-pre-send-preview`) for explicitly attached files, selections, current note, folders,
and MCP resources, and render them as citations on grounded answers.

## Acceptance criteria

- A current-note answer can cite the note or selected range that grounded it.
- Citation fixture tests cover attached file / selection / current-note / MCP-resource cases.

## Out of scope

- Local keyword/metadata retrieval (Phase B) and embeddings (Phase C) — separate, later.
