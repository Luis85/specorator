# Context has no pre-send trust envelope or citation handle

## Summary

Context is assembled and sent without a normalized envelope that records provenance, estimated size, trust level, and source handles. This leaves three connected gaps: users cannot preview exactly what will be sent, prompts do not consistently demarcate untrusted content, and assistant answers cannot cite the note/selection that grounded them.

## Evidence

- `src/core/prompt/mainAgent.ts` documents XML tags for current note, editor selection, and browser selection, but it does not define a structured context source model or citation handle.
- `src/core/prompt/inlineEdit.ts` appends selections/context files directly into prompt strings.
- No production `ContextSourceHandle` or citation model exists in `src/`.
- Existing issue docs remain open: [[composer-context-pre-send-preview]], [[explicit-context-citations]], and [[prompt-injection-untrusted-content-demarcation]].

## Why it matters

In an Obsidian vault, source trust varies: a user's own note, an external browser selection, an MCP resource, and an image OCR result should not all look like equivalent instructions. Without provenance, the UI cannot explain what was sent, the model cannot reliably cite sources, and prompt-injection defense relies almost entirely on approval mode.

## Suggested remediation

1. Introduce a provider-neutral `ComposerContextBuilder` that emits context items, not provider prompt strings.
2. Each item should include source type, path/range, trust/provenance, token estimate, and a stable citation handle.
3. Render a pre-send context preview drawer from this envelope.
4. Provider prompt encoders should wrap untrusted/external content in labeled data blocks.
5. Render citations for explicitly attached context first; defer embeddings/RAG to a later phase.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] The composer can show exactly which files, ranges, folders, images, browser selections, and MCP resources are attached before send.
- [x] Untrusted/external context is clearly delimited in provider prompts. — shipped 2026-06-10, see progress note.
- [ ] Assistant output can cite an explicitly attached note or selected range.
- [ ] Unit tests cover current note, file, folder, selection, image, MCP, and external-path context items.

## Progress (2026-06-10): trust demarcation shipped

The security-relevant slice landed; `src/core/context/` now exists as the
substrate the roadmap names (`untrustedContent.ts`):

- `ContextTrust` provenance model (`vault` / `granted-external` /
  `untrusted-external`) and `wrapUntrustedExternalData()`, which wraps
  external content in `<untrusted_external_data>` and escapes embedded
  closing tags so content cannot break out of the envelope.
- Browser selections — the one context source that crosses the trust
  boundary today — are demarcated on **all four providers**: the XML path
  (`utils/browser.formatBrowserContext`, used by Claude + Opencode) emits
  `trust="untrusted-external"` plus the wrapped body, and the sectioned path
  (`core/prompt/sectionedTurn`, used by Codex + Cursor) wraps the bracketed
  block body, which previously interpolated raw web text with no escaping at
  all.
- The shared system prompt (`core/prompt/mainAgent`, used by Claude, Codex,
  and Opencode) gained an "Untrusted external content" section defining the
  envelope contract (data not instructions; surface injection attempts).
  Cursor builds its prompt without `buildSystemPrompt`, so it gets the
  envelope but not the system-prompt contract — revisit if Cursor gains a
  shared-prompt path.

Still open: the pre-send context preview (needs the full
`ContextSourceHandle`/`ContextEnvelope` model with token estimates), citation
handles, and item-level unit coverage for the remaining source types.

## Settled design (2026-06-14, architecture grilling)

Revises the line above ("build the envelope model when the preview drawer is
designed"): the **four turn encoders are themselves the real consumer**, so the
envelope ships now as their shared seam (a behaviour-preserving deepening), and
the preview/citations consume it later. Domain terms **Context source** /
**Context envelope** added to `CONTEXT.md`.

- **`buildContextEnvelope(request: ChatTurnRequest): ContextEnvelope`** in
  `core/context/` — gathers the four request sources (current note, editor
  selection, browser selection, canvas selection) into a normalized
  `ContextSource[]`. Each source: `sourceType` (discriminant), `trust:
  ContextTrust`, the raw selection context it carries, a `tokenEstimate`
  (chars/4 for v1) and a stable `citationHandle` (e.g. `ctx:editor:<path>:<range>`).
- **`renderContextEnvelope`** renders the envelope to a Provider's wire format —
  keyed **per Provider, not by a bare `'xml'|'sectioned'`**. Claude + Opencode
  reuse the `utils/{context,editor,browser,canvas}` `format*` helpers (XML);
  Codex + Cursor reuse `core/prompt/sectionedTurn`'s brackets for the **selection**
  sources (editor / browser / canvas), which are byte-identical within the style.
  The four encoders still collapse onto build+render, byte-identical to today.
  **Caveat — the current-note hint stays provider-specific glue, outside the
  shared renderer:** `encodeSectionedTurn` already takes a per-provider
  `buildContextHints` callback because Codex emits a terse `[Current note: <path>]`
  while Cursor emits a longer actionable instruction (the bare hint is ignored by
  cursor-agent). So `buildContextEnvelope` owns gather / trust / estimate / handles
  for all four sources, but the **current-note rendering** remains each provider's
  callback — folding it into a style-keyed renderer would regress one of the two.
- **Trust:** `buildContextEnvelope` owns trust *assignment* (browser →
  `untrusted-external`). Byte-parity needs style-specific escaping of untrusted
  bodies (XML escapes, sectioned doesn't), so the `wrapUntrustedExternalData`
  call stays inside the renderers; a single test over `renderContextEnvelope`
  enforces the "untrusted is always wrapped" invariant across both styles.
- **v1 scope:** the deepening only — model + seam + migrate the four chat-turn
  sources, byte-parity. Deferred to follow-ups: `inlineEdit` migration, the
  pre-send preview drawer, output citations, and new source types (file /
  folder / image / MCP resource). Those are the remaining acceptance criteria.
- **Tests:** `buildContextEnvelope` (per source → trust *assignment* / fields /
  estimate / handle; browser → `untrusted-external`; empty/compact — no wrapping
  here), per-style render byte-parity, the single `renderContextEnvelope`
  invariant test that untrusted sources come out wrapped in both styles, and the
  existing encoder suites stay green as the safety net (the interface is the
  test surface).

## Progress (2026-06-14): envelope seam shipped (v1 deepening)

The deepening landed exactly as settled above. `src/core/context/contextEnvelope.ts`
now owns the gather/trust/estimate/handle step, and the four turn encoders render
it instead of re-implementing the gather:

- **`buildContextEnvelope(request)`** returns a `ContextSource[]` (discriminated
  union: `vault-note` / `editor-selection` / `browser-selection` /
  `canvas-selection`), each tagged with `trust`, a `tokenEstimate` (chars/4) and a
  stable `citationHandle` (`ctx:note:…`, `ctx:editor:<path>:<range>`,
  `ctx:browser:<url|source>`, `ctx:canvas:<path>`). Browser sources are tagged
  `untrusted-external` here, but the body is left raw — assignment only.
- **`renderContextEnvelopeXml`** (Claude + Opencode) maps each source through the
  `utils/{context,editor,browser,canvas}` `format*` helpers and drops empties;
  callers join `[text, ...blocks]` with `\n\n`, byte-identical to the old
  `append*` chain. **`renderContextEnvelopeSectioned`** (Codex + Cursor) emits the
  bracketed editor/browser/canvas sections; the untrusted browser body is wrapped
  here (no XML escaping in this style). The current-note hint stays each provider's
  `buildContextHints` callback (Codex terse / Cursor verbose), outside the shared
  renderer — folding it in would regress one of the two.
- The now-dead `append{CurrentNote,EditorContext,BrowserContext,CanvasContext}`
  wrappers were removed (their only callers were the migrated encoders);
  `appendContextFiles` stays (inline-edit). The `format*` helpers stay (the
  renderer + `utils/session` consume them).
- Coverage: `tests/unit/core/context/contextEnvelope.test.ts` (builder trust/field/
  estimate/handle + no-wrap, per-style byte-parity, the cross-style untrusted-wrap
  invariant); the four encoder suites stayed green as the behaviour-preservation
  net. Quality ratchet unchanged (metric-flat deepening).

Still open (deferred follow-ups, unchanged acceptance criteria): the pre-send
preview drawer, output citations, the `inlineEdit` migration, and new source types
(file / folder / image / MCP resource).
