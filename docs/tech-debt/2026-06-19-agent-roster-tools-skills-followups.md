# Agent Roster / Tools / Skills — Increment 1 Follow-ups

Increment 1 (PR #117) shipped the provider-agnostic Agent Roster, a user-authored
Tool Library (manifest+handler, sucrase transpile, zod validation) exposed to
Claude via an in-process SDK MCP server, and a Skill Library — each in a
dedicated workspace view. These items were deliberately deferred or surfaced in
final review and remain open.

## Functional gaps

1. ~~**User tools reach Claude's cold-start path only, not the persistent query.**~~
   **RESOLVED (2026-06-19).** `applyClaudeDynamicUpdates`/`updateMcpServers` now
   merges the in-process `claudian` server into every `setMcpServers` call (after
   SSRF vetting, since it's an `sdk`-type server) and tracks its presence in the
   MCP key, so it is no longer dropped on dynamic model/permission/MCP updates.
   *Residual:* adding a tool **mid-session** isn't reflected on the live persistent
   query until the managed-MCP set changes or a new conversation cold-starts
   (the key tracks claudian presence, not its tool-set contents) — a minor,
   acceptable limitation; a fresh conversation always cold-starts with current tools.

2. **Cross-provider tools — Opencode + Cursor done; Codex deferred.** Superseded
   the stdio plan with an **in-process local HTTP MCP server** (full Obsidian
   context; see `2026-06-19-http-tool-tier-design`). Shipped 2026-06-19: the
   plugin hosts a loopback Streamable-HTTP MCP server (per-process bearer token,
   constant-time auth); **Opencode** (`mcp.claudian` in the managed config) and
   **Cursor** (`~/.cursor/mcp.json` written pre-spawn, preserving user servers)
   are wired. *Deferred:* **Codex** — its `app-server` exposes no MCP-config seam
   in the plugin (`reloadMcpServers` is a no-op; unclear whether it reads
   `mcp_servers` from config.toml). Needs upstream/runtime investigation. Respect
   the Cursor ~40-tool cap.

3. **Skill Library is view + discovery only; no canonical `.claudian/skills`
   store or provider projection.** Skills are surfaced from existing provider
   catalogs; the provider-neutral canonical store + write-through projection from
   the spec is deferred. *(Its own increment — not a quick follow-up.)*

4. **Roster → run binding — chat + work-order done.** Shipped 2026-06-19:
   "Start chat with this Agent" (roster cards + detail) reliably opens a Claude
   conversation bound to a `RosterAgent`; a header chip shows the bound agent with
   an unbind action; the agent's **system prompt + model** apply to every turn.
   **Work-orders** can be assigned a roster agent (agent picker lists
   `roster:<id>` agents) and runs consume it (`boundAgentId` threaded
   coordinator → execution surface → run conversation, consume-once per tab).
   **Non-Claude projection done (2026-06-19).** Binding an agent now applies its
   **system prompt + model** across all four providers: `InputController` folds
   `boundAgentModel` into `queryOptions.model` (explicit tab/work-order override
   wins; bound model is the fallback) so the three providers that read
   `queryOptions.model` pick it up for free, and each runtime appends the bound
   prompt per turn — Codex via `buildSystemPrompt` appendices (`baseInstructions`
   re-sent on `thread/start` **and** `thread/resume`), Cursor via a delimited
   `# Agent Instructions` section in the CLI prompt, Opencode via the same
   appended section in the ACP prompt blocks. Claude is unchanged
   (`resolveEffectiveModel` already reads `boundAgentModel` separately).
   **Roster-agent board avatars done (2026-06-20).** `rosterAgentToPersona` +
   a preloaded `buildPersonaResolver` (mirroring `buildAgentOptionsLoader`,
   invalidated on `roster:changed`) now render each roster agent's color +
   initials on the board card footer, the work-order detail modal agent row, and
   the read-only activity modal. *Still open:* **tool/skill enforcement** at run
   time — see item 9.

## Quality / polish

5. ~~**Inconsistent i18n.**~~ **RESOLVED (2026-06-20).** The roster detail field
   labels and the `ToolLibraryView` / `SkillLibraryView` literals now route
   through `t()` (`agentRoster.field*`, `toolLibrary.*`, `skillLibrary.*`). The 9
   non-English locales hold English copies of the new keys (structural parity
   passes; translation of the copies remains open as ordinary i18n backlog).

6. ~~**`ToolHostContext.signal` is inert.**~~ **RESOLVED (2026-06-20).** Both tool
   host boundaries (SDK + HTTP) now thread the MCP request's `AbortSignal` (from
   the handler's `extra`) into `ToolHostContext` via the shared `requestSignal()`
   helper, so an aborted turn cancels a long-running user tool. Falls back to a
   fresh never-aborted signal when the host supplies none.

7. **Output schema unused — needs a structured-output channel first.**
   `ClaudianToolManifest.output` is reserved, but handlers return only a
   `ToolTextResult` text envelope, so there is nothing structured to validate
   `output` against today. Validating the text envelope against a zod schema is
   meaningless; this needs a structured-result channel (handler returns parsed
   data alongside text) before `output` can be enforced. Deferred by design, not
   an oversight.

8. ~~**`buildColdStartOptions` CRAP score.**~~ **RESOLVED (2026-06-20).** Added
   targeted unit coverage for the `getClaudianToolServer` branch (server present
   merges `mcpServers.claudian`; absent omits it), the proportionate fix.

9. **Roster tool/skill enforcement — user-tool scoping done (2026-06-20).**
   Chosen direction: **scope user tools per conversation.** A bound agent's
   granted capability ids (`RosterAgent.tools`) now flow `resolveBoundAgent` →
   `boundAgentTools` on `ChatRuntimeQueryOptions` → `currentBoundAgentTools` on
   the Claude runtime → `getClaudianToolServer(grantedToolIds)`, which scopes the
   in-process claudian tool server to only the granted ids (empty/absent grant =
   all user tools, preserving the prior default). Applies on both the cold-start
   and dynamic-update (persistent-query `setMcpServers`) paths. Built-in Claude
   tools (Read/Write/Bash) are untouched. *Still open:* the roster UI grants only
   user tools — built-in tool allow/deny and `disallowedTools` editing have no UI
   yet; **non-Claude (HTTP-tier) scoping Phase 1 shipped (2026-06-22)** — the HTTP
   tool server is now grant-aware (per-grant scoped token, enforced by
   construction) and Opencode/Cursor thread the grant in (see Hardening-pass item
   2 + the grant-scoping spec); Phase 2 (cross-conversation re-scoping on a reused
   provider process) remains; true per-call enforcement still needs `canUseTool`.

## New starter-agent presets (2026-06-20)

Shipped eight installable starter agents (Feature Builder, Debugger, Refactorer,
Test Author, Researcher, Documentation Writer, Planner, Code Reviewer) via
`presetAgents.ts` + an "Install starter agents" button in the roster view,
mirroring the work-order template presets (non-destructive: skips ids that
already exist). Presets ship prompt + identity only; tools/skills start empty
because those are vault-specific. *Open polish:* the preset prompts are English
literals (not i18n'd, same as work-order template bodies).

## Hardening pass (2026-06-21)

A deep harden/polish pass over the roster + tool/skill surfaces landed the
contained fixes (provider-projection sanitization, tool-handler timeout +
result bounding, tool-name validation/dup detection, the persistent-query
tool-scope staleness key, the synchronous persona resolver, error notices,
and modal/a11y polish). Three larger items were triaged out as genuine
decisions rather than bugs:

1. **User-tool trust model (consent gate).** User tools run as trusted
   in-process code with full Node/host privileges — a deliberate product
   choice. The timeout + output bounds added in this pass guard the *runaway*
   failure mode, not the *malicious* one. A first-run "this tool runs with full
   vault/host access — enable?" consent gate (per-tool, remembered) would close
   the trust gap without sandboxing. Open question: gate per-tool, or a single
   "I trust my .claudian/tools" workspace toggle. Needs a product call before
   building.

2. **Opencode/Cursor HTTP-tier tool-scope relocation — Phase 1 shipped
   (2026-06-22).** The loopback HTTP tool server is now grant-aware: it keys a
   per-grant scoped MCP layer by bearer token and enforces scoping by
   construction (a tool outside the grant is never registered on that layer's
   server), and Opencode/Cursor thread the bound agent's `boundAgentTools` into
   `getHttpToolServerConfig(grant)` so a restricted agent gets a scoped token
   (no grant → byte-identical all-tools default). Design + Phase split:
   `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-22-http-tool-tier-grant-scoping-design.md`.
   *Phase 2 (still deferred, needs a live runtime):* cross-conversation
   re-scoping when a provider reuses one long-running process/config across
   conversations with different grants — Cursor's global `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
   race and Opencode's spawn-once config — plus the ~40-tool Cursor cap and
   token lifecycle. The per-token server guarantee holds regardless; what needs
   runtime validation is which token a given spawn actually picks up.

3. **Locale coverage for new strings.** The roster/tool/skill UI strings and the
   eight preset-agent prompts are English literals; the nine non-English locales
   fall back to English for the new keys. A full translation pass (~720 strings ×
   9 locales) is a sizeable, separate effort.

## Improvement pass deferrals (2026-06-22)

A 5-lens review (UX, accessibility, security/resilience, architecture, i18n) drove
a nine-increment improvement pass. The contained items shipped; these were
deliberately deferred (tracked here):

1. **Bulk translation — still deferred (user call).** ~837 locale entries (95
   agent-feature keys × 9 locales) plus the 8 preset-agent prompts remain English
   (the `ribbon.*`/`commands.*` keys added in item 6 below are likewise English
   copies in the 9 non-English locales). The structural i18n bugs (dollar-brace
   interpolation, dead keys, hardcoded strings, color-picker label) were fixed;
   the translation backlog is the remaining work and benefits from native review.
   Kept deferred for a native-reviewed pass.
2. ~~**Atomic config writes.**~~ **RESOLVED (2026-06-22).** Added
   `VaultFileAdapter.writeAtomic` (write to `${path}.tmp` then rename onto the
   target; delete-then-retry fallback for adapters that refuse to overwrite on
   rename; the orphan `.tmp` is cleaned up before rethrow if the retry also
   fails). `AgentRosterStore.save` and `SessionStorage.saveMetadata` now use it,
   so a mid-write crash leaves either the intact old file or the fully-written
   new one — never a truncated JSON config.
3. ~~**HTTP tool-server in-flight drain.**~~ **RESOLVED (2026-06-22).**
   `ClaudianHttpToolServer.rebuild()` now awaits a bounded drain (5s ceiling,
   25ms poll) before tearing down the MCP layer. An in-flight counter tracks
   transport-bound requests (incremented before `transport.handleRequest`,
   decremented exactly once on `res` `finish`/`close` via a `settled` guard;
   `close` is the backstop for aborted/errored requests). New requests during the
   drain still hit the old, still-attached transport. `stop()` is unchanged.
4. ~~**Project tool-grant restrictions into provider subagents.**~~ **RESOLVED
   via documentation (2026-06-22).** Chose the "document the divergence in the UI"
   option: the Tools card in the roster detail editor now carries a muted caption
   (`agentRoster.toolGrantScopeHint`) explaining that the grant applies on the
   bound-chat path while agents synced to providers as `@`-mentionable subagents
   inherit the provider's default tool access. Mapping the grant into each
   provider's native `tools`/`disallowedTools` stays deferred — it needs live
   per-provider runtime validation and can't be done blind.
5. **Turn-cancel → running tool — still deferred (low impact).** When the MCP
   host omits a request signal, a user cancelling a turn can't abort an in-flight
   tool; it runs to the 30s ceiling (the bounded-handler backstop added in the
   2026-06-21 harden pass). Threading the runtime turn `AbortSignal` into the tool
   ctx needs the host to actually supply a signal on the cancel path; the 30s
   ceiling bounds the worst case, so this is left deferred as a low-impact
   refinement rather than risk an unvalidatable change to the cancel plumbing.
6. ~~**`getDisplayText`/ribbon/command i18n.**~~ **RESOLVED (2026-06-22).** View
   titles (`getDisplayText`) reuse the existing `*.title` keys; ribbon tooltips
   and command-palette names route through `t()` via new `ribbon.*`/`commands.*`
   namespaces (all 10 locales + typed unions). `setLocale` runs inside
   `loadSettings`, which `onload` awaits before registering ribbon icons and
   commands, so these resolve the configured locale at registration time. (Live
   re-registration on a mid-session locale change remains out of scope; view
   `getDisplayText` self-heals since Obsidian re-invokes it.) `ClaudianView`
   stays the `'Claudian'` brand name.
7. ~~**Library-shell unification.**~~ **RESOLVED (2026-06-22).** `AgentRosterView`
   now builds its list shell and cards on the shared `renderLibraryShell` /
   `createLibraryCard` helpers. `createLibraryCard` gained a backward-compatible
   options arg (a `leading` media slot for the avatar, `nameAsButton` for the
   keyboard-focusable name button) and now also returns the card element; the
   Tool/Skill call sites pass no opts and render identical DOM. All six roster
   card a11y properties are preserved.
8. ~~**Tab-strip roving tabindex.**~~ **RESOLVED (2026-06-22).** The chat tab
   strip now follows the WAI-ARIA APG tabs-with-manual-activation pattern: exactly
   one roving tab stop (the active badge, or the first when none is active), all
   others `tabindex="-1"`; ArrowLeft/Right (wrap) + Home/End move focus and shift
   the roving stop without activating (Enter/Space still activate, Delete/Backspace
   still close).
