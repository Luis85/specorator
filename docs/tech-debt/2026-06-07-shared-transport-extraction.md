# Shared transport helpers from ADR-0001 are still unextracted

## Summary

The provider seam is intentionally provider-native, but the CLI providers still duplicate lower-level process and JSON-RPC plumbing. ADR-0001 accepted an optional `core/transport` extraction; the directory does not exist yet.

## Evidence

- `src/core/transport/` is absent.
- Current transport/process modules reviewed on 2026-06-07:
  - `src/providers/codex/runtime/CodexRpcTransport.ts` — 143 nonblank LOC.
  - `src/providers/codex/runtime/CodexAppServerProcess.ts` — 131 nonblank LOC.
  - `src/providers/acp/AcpJsonRpcTransport.ts` — 369 nonblank LOC.
  - `src/providers/acp/AcpSubprocess.ts` — 130 nonblank LOC.
  - `src/providers/cursor/runtime/cursorLaunch.ts` — 103 nonblank LOC.
- The subprocess modules repeat the same concerns: spawn, stderr buffering, process liveness, SIGTERM/SIGKILL, and disposal.
- The JSON-RPC transports are not identical, but share enough concepts to benefit from a common request map / line framing / shutdown helper.

## Why it matters

Transport failures are high-risk because they appear as hung turns, stuck approvals, orphaned processes, or lost provider state. Duplicated low-level plumbing makes it harder to apply lifecycle fixes uniformly and harder for agents to reason about which provider path owns which cancellation invariant.

## Suggested remediation

1. Extract a small process helper first: spawn, stderr ring buffer, cooperative close, SIGTERM to SIGKILL escalation, exit callbacks.
2. Keep JSON-RPC helpers optional and capability-aware; do not force Cursor's NDJSON stream or Claude's SDK path through a fake common transport.
3. Add transport-level tests for pending request rejection, process exit, abort/timeout cleanup, and stderr diagnostics.
4. Add a perf or reliability gate if JSON-RPC request volume becomes hot.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] `src/core/transport/` contains a reusable process helper used by Codex and Opencode. — `AgentSubprocess` (2026-06-13), wrapped by `CodexAppServerProcess` and `AcpSubprocess`.
- [x] Provider-native differences remain inside provider adapters. — Codex keeps `resolveWindowsSpawnSpec` (`.cmd`-shim) + its `onExit(code,signal)` contract; Opencode keeps `onClose(error?)`; the helper exposes a normalized `onClose({ reason, code, signal, error })` both map from.
- [x] Transport tests cover shutdown, pending request rejection, and stderr diagnostics. — shutdown (SIGTERM→SIGKILL escalation + give-up ceiling), stderr bounding/snapshot, and close-notification in `AgentSubprocess.test.ts`; pending-request rejection on dispose/stream-close, plus timeout/abort cleanup, in `JsonRpcStdioClient.test.ts` (step 2, 2026-06-14).
- [x] No provider loses current cancellation or approval-dismiss behavior. — the existing `AcpSubprocess`/`CodexAppServerProcess` + transport/runtime consumer suites pass unchanged.

## Progress (2026-06-13, quality campaign run 15)

Remediation **step 1 shipped**: extracted `src/core/transport/AgentSubprocess.ts` — spawn, an
8 KB stderr ring buffer, liveness, a single normalized close notification, and the hardened
SIGTERM→SIGKILL→give-up `shutdown()` (the CON-2 fix, now in one tested place). `CodexAppServerProcess`
and `AcpSubprocess` are thin adapters over it; Codex additionally gained free stderr diagnostics
(it previously buffered none). Incidentally removed the cross-zone `shutdown()` clone
(`cloneGroups` 33 → 32, `duplicatedLines` 819 → 803). **Deferred (step 2):** the optional
capability-aware JSON-RPC client (`CodexRpcTransport` / `AcpJsonRpcTransport` share request-map /
line-framing / shutdown concepts) and its pending-request-rejection tests — a larger, separate slice.

## Resolution (2026-06-14, quality campaign run 16)

`done`. Remediation **step 2 shipped**: extracted `src/core/transport/JsonRpcStdioClient.ts` — the
newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0 client (request/response correlation map, request timeouts + abort,
server-notification and server-request routing, line framing, and pending-request rejection on
close/dispose) riding a `JsonRpcMessageStreams` abstraction. `AcpJsonRpcTransport` was already
provider-agnostic, so it became a re-export of the core client (zero Opencode-consumer churn);
`CodexRpcTransport` is now a thin adapter bridging the Codex subprocess to the client and keeping
its API (including server-request handlers that receive the request id). Capability-aware as the
remediation required — ACP keeps abort/typed-errors, Codex keeps its id-passing server requests —
and **no provider is forced through a fake common transport** (Cursor's NDJSON and Claude's SDK
paths are untouched). Behavior-preserving: the existing transport unit suites + the
transport/runtime consumer suites (`CodexChatRuntime`, `CodexAuxQueryRunner`, `CodexSkillListingService`,
`AcpClientConnection`, Opencode runtime) pass unchanged, with a new `JsonRpcStdioClient` spec.
Remediation item 4 (a JSON-RPC request-volume perf gate) stays optional/deferred — request volume is
not a current hot path.
