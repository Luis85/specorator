# Specorator

You're already using AI for serious work. Drafting emails. Planning trips. Comparing options. Reading the long report you don't want to read yourself. The conversations help, but the moment you close the tab, the work is gone. Tomorrow you start again from scratch.

**Specorator** brings that work inside your Obsidian vault. The drafts, plans, summaries, and edits land in notes you keep. Conversations are saved too, so you can pick one up tomorrow instead of starting fresh.

## What it solves

- Typing the same prompts every day. Save any prompt as a vault note and fire it from a one-tap picker.
- Being locked into one tool's UI for one provider. Use whichever providers you have access to, in one workspace.
- AI work scattering across thirty open tabs. A board tracks every handoff from inbox to done.
- The agent quietly changing your notes. Preview every edit before it lands, or flip on YOLO mode when you trust the run.

## What you get

- Hours back on the work that wears you down. Summaries, comparisons, first drafts, and long reads happen while you do the next thing.
- A workspace where every chat, plan, and draft lands as a note you can find again, not a tab you close and forget.
- The right level of oversight, set by you. Read every change before it lands, or hand the run to YOLO mode.
- Use of whatever AI access you already pay for. One workspace, no separate login per tool.
- A clear record of how a decision got made. Useful when the email lands a week later, when the contract needs a second look, when someone asks how you settled on it.

## What's inside

| Feature                    | What it is                                                                                               |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[Co-Worker - Chat]]                 | A workspace beside your notes that already knows what you're looking at and what you've highlighted.     |
| [[Multi Provider Support]] | Different engines for different jobs. Pick the one that fits the moment.                                 |
| [[Quick Actions]]          | Your most-used prompts, one tap away. Stored as vault notes you own.                                     |
| [[Agent Kanban Board]]     | A board for things you have handed off. Inbox to done, never lost in chat history.                       |

Not sure where a task belongs? Use [[chat-vs-agent-board]]: start in chat for fast foreground work, then move durable handoffs to the board when they need priority, acceptance criteria, background-style running, or review.

## What this is not

- Not a code-only tool. The plugin is for anyone who works in notes. Writers, planners, researchers, students, small-business owners, parents, anyone keeping track of thinking in their vault.
- Not a hosted service. Your notes live on your computer. No account is required.
- Not a single-provider lock-in. Use whichever providers you have access to. If you only have one, that is fine; the workspace works the same.
- Not magic. You decide the level of oversight. Preview every change before you accept it, or flip on YOLO mode and let the agent run on its own. The setting is yours.
- Specorator sits inside Obsidian and respects how Obsidian works. If you leave Specorator, your notes are still ordinary Markdown.

## Who it's for

If you keep your thinking in a vault and you want help with the mechanical parts of that thinking, this is for you. You don't need to know what an API is. You don't need to write code. You need a folder of notes and a willingness to treat the AI provider less like a search bar and more like a co-worker you give work to. Start with one chat in the sidebar. When you catch yourself typing the same prompt twice, save it as a Quick Action your co-worker can run on tap. When one question turns into a durable handoff, put it on the Agent Board so it keeps a record. When the list of things you've handed off starts to slip, open the board and treat it like a shared backlog between the two of you.

## Where it's heading

**Specorator v1.0.0** is today's feature set — Chat, Multi-Provider, Quick Actions, Agent Board — rebranded from the Claudian codebase and shipped as a standalone plugin. It does **not** wait on the harness work below. What follows is the **post-1.0 harness roadmap** layered on top of that rebrand: making the assistant something a person who has never opened a terminal can install and trust. The plan is the **[[Specorator Agent Harness PRD]]**.

The short version of that plan: keep the depth Specorator already has — real AI engines, working side by side, with your notes underneath — and close the three things that today still ask too much of a non-technical person.

- **Setup without a terminal.** Install, add one key, ask your first question. No command line, no hunting for where a program lives, no error you can't read. (Quick answers need no install at all; full AI engines fetch a helper program for you — in-app, still no terminal.)
- **Trust you can see and take back.** Changes shown before they land, and a one-click *revert your vault to the way it was before the agent's last turn*. We're building that revert to cover every engine; today it's most reliable on Claude. On most engines you also approve each change *before* it happens; on a few, that before-the-fact preview isn't possible, so the revert is the safety net. Specorator tells you which is which, the way the [[Multi Provider Support]] matrix already does — it never pretends an engine protects more than it does.
- **An assistant that actually knows your vault.** It follows your links, reads your tags and properties, finds the note you half-remember, and carries what it learns about your work from one day to the next — instead of treating your vault as a plain folder of files.
- **Set it up by tapping, not by editing files.** The things that shape your assistant — saved workflows, connected tools, and standing rules like "always cite sources" — live in the same one-tap surface as Quick Actions. No config files, no JSON, no provider-specific folders. Set a rule once and every engine follows it.

Underneath those, the same plan adds sensible spending limits and a security model designed so a booby-trapped web clip or PDF can't quietly turn your assistant against your own notes.

The goal behind all of it: bring the power of frontier AI coding tools to anyone who keeps their thinking in a vault — without the terminal, the setup, or the jargon.
